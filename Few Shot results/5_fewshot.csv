Write a function that checks if all cars are electric and returns True if some cars are electric but only if they are new.,"Contradiction: The universal statement (""all cars are electric"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""some cars are electric but only if they are new""). This implies that not all cars can be electric, as it introduces a condition (being new) that restricts which cars can be electric.

Subtype: Alius (different conditions applied to both statements)."
"Write a function that checks if all products are on sale and returns True if some products are on sale, but only if they have a discount.","The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The requirement states that the function should return True if all products are on sale and also returns True if some products are on sale but only if they have a discount. These two conditions contradict each other because it is not possible for both ""all products"" and just ""some products"" to be true simultaneously in this context without additional clarification or conditions.
Type: Contradictory (mutually exclusive opposites).
Subtype: Idem (same condition applied to both states, i.e., being on sale)."
"Write a function that checks if all students passed and returns True if some students passed, but only if they studied.","The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all students passed"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""some students passed but only if they studied""). Specifically, if all students have passed, then it's redundant and contradictory to condition this on whether some subset of them passed due to studying.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Idem (same condition applied to both statements, with a logical inconsistency)."
"Write a function that checks if all tickets are sold and returns True if some tickets are sold, but only if they were purchased early.","The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all tickets are sold"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""some tickets are sold but only if they were purchased early""). These statements cannot be true simultaneously because one implies that all tickets have been sold without any condition regarding purchase time, while the other specifies a condition about when those some tickets must have been bought to be considered ""sold"". Additionally, it's unclear how checking for early purchases aligns with verifying if all tickets are sold.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Complex (multiple conditions applied across both states)."
"Write a function that checks if all employees are full-time and returns True if some employees are full-time, but only if they have benefits.","The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.

Contradiction: The universal statement (""all employees are full-time"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""some employees are full-time but only if they have benefits""). Specifically, if all employees are already established as full-time, then there's no need for an additional condition that specifies some subset of those full-time employees must also have benefits. The requirement implies a contradiction between asserting that all employees meet a certain status (full-time) and simultaneously qualifying a subset based on an additional criterion (benefits).

Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
"Write a function that checks if all phones are smartphones and returns True if some phones are smartphones, but only if they have a touchscreen.","The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all phones are smartphones"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""some phones are smartphones but only if they have a touchscreen""). These two statements cannot both be true simultaneously because one asserts that all phones must be smartphones while the other implies there can exist non-smartphones among the phones.

Subtype: Alius (different conditions applied to both statements)."
"Write a function that checks if all tasks are completed and returns True if some tasks are completed, but only if they are urgent.","The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.

Contradiction: The universal statement (""all tasks are completed"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""some tasks are completed""). Additionally, there's an inconsistency regarding the condition that these ""some tasks"" must be urgent for the function to return True. This means we have conflicting requirements about the completeness of all tasks versus a subset of tasks being both incomplete and urgent.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements) combined with additional condition complexity.
Subtype: Complex (involves conditions that create dependency between two different scopes of tasks)."
"Write a function that checks if all animals are domesticated and returns True if some animals are domesticated, but only if they live indoors.","The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all animals are domesticated"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""some animals are domesticated but only if they live indoors""). It's contradictory because one cannot say that all animals are domesticated and simultaneously restrict some of them to be indoor-dwelling for being domesticated.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Alius (different conditions applied to both statements)."
"Write a function that checks if all restaurants are open and returns True if some restaurants are open, but only if they serve breakfast.","The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The requirement states that all restaurants must be open and serving breakfast for the function to return True. However, it is contradictory because if some restaurants are open but only serve breakfast (and not necessarily all), then the condition ""all restaurants are open"" does not make sense unless we know they all specifically serve breakfast during their open hours.

Type: Contrary (mutually inconsistent but not exhaustive).
Subtype: Alius (different conditions applied to both states)."
"Write a function that checks if all books are available and returns True if some books are available, but only if they are new.","The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The requirement states that the function should check if all books are available (implying an evaluation of every book), but then it contradicts itself by saying it returns True if some books are available under specific conditions (new). Moreover, ""all books"" and ""some books"" are contradictory in terms of scope when combined with the condition that they must be new. This is a case where a universal statement conflicts with a conditional statement.

Subtype: Alius (different conditions applied to both statements)."
Write a function that checks if all students in a list have passed and returns True if some students have passed.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all students have passed"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some students have passed""). These statements cannot both be true simultaneously as they represent opposite extremes in the scenario described.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all items are expensive and returns True if some items are expensive.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The requirement asks the function to check if all items are expensive and then separately returns True if some items are expensive. These two conditions are contradictory because ""all"" implies that every item must be expensive, while ""some"" means only part of the items need to be expensive. This conflicts with the logical dependency between universal (""all"") and existential (""some"") statements.

Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all lights are on and returns True if some lights are on.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.

Contradiction: The requirement asks the function to check if all lights are on and simultaneously returns True if some lights are on. These statements contradict each other because checking that ""all lights are on"" implies no lights can be off, whereas returning True for ""some lights being on"" is ambiguous without specifying what happens when not all lights are on.

Type: Contradictory (mutually exclusive opposites).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all employees are active and returns True if some employees are active.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all employees are active"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some employees are active""). If all employees must be active (universal condition), then it should always return true for ""some employees being active"" since all would fulfill this. Hence, these statements conflict each other.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all transactions were successful and returns True if some transactions were successful.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all transactions were successful"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some transactions were successful""). If all transactions are successful, then it's redundant or contradictory to check for ""some"" being successful since that would always be true under the first condition.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all items are available and returns True if some items are available.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all items are available"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some items are available""). These statements cannot both be true at the same time under normal logical conditions.
Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all websites are up and returns True if some websites are up.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all websites are up"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some websites are up""). These statements cannot both be true simultaneously under the same conditions.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all students are graduated and returns True if some students are graduated.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The requirement states that the function should check if all students are graduated and simultaneously returns True if some students are graduated. This is contradictory because if ""all"" implies universality (meaning every single student), then it logically excludes any scenario where only ""some"" or less than all students meet the condition. These statements cannot coexist in a meaningful, logical program.

Type: Contradictory (mutually exclusive opposites).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all cars are working and returns True if some cars are working.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all cars are working"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some cars are working""). A function cannot simultaneously check that all cars are working and return true based on only some being operational unless it's redefined as checking for the partial condition after confirming universality, which isn't clearly stated here.
Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all tasks are completed and returns True if some tasks are completed.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all tasks are completed"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some tasks are completed""). These statements cannot both be true simultaneously.

Type: Contrary (mutually inconsistent but not exhaustive).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all numbers are even and returns True if some numbers are even.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The requirement states that the function should ""check if all numbers are even and returns True if some numbers are even."" This is contradictory because if all numbers are even (universal statement), it implies that there cannot be a scenario where only some numbers are even. These two statements contradict each other.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Idem (same condition applied to both statements)."
Write a function that checks if all workers are busy and returns True if some workers are busy.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all workers are busy"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some workers are busy""). If all workers are busy (universal statement), then it inherently means that there are some workers who are busy (conditional statement). However, the requirement suggests checking for both conditions separately, which is logically inconsistent.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all books are available and returns True if some books are available.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.

Contradiction: The requirement specifies that the function should check if all books are available and return True if some books are available. This creates an inherent contradiction because checking if all books are available implies a condition that is either universally true or false for every book in consideration, while returning True if some books are available contradicts this universal statement by implying a conditional or partial truth.
Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all jobs are open and returns True if some jobs are open.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The universal statement (""all jobs are open"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some jobs are open""). If all jobs are open, then it inherently means that some jobs are also open. However, checking for ""some"" when you have already established that ""all"" meet a certain condition creates a contradiction in requirements.
Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all dogs are trained and returns True if some dogs are trained.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.

Contradiction: The universal statement (""all dogs are trained"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some dogs are trained""). These statements cannot coexist because if all dogs are trained, then it implies that there isn't just some dogs trained but all of them. This creates an inconsistency between what needs to be checked universally and conditionally.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all fruits are fresh and returns True if some fruits are fresh.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.

Contradiction: The universal statement (""all fruits are fresh"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some fruits are fresh""). These statements cannot both be true at the same time because they express contradictory conditions about the set of fruits.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all courses are online and returns True if some courses are online.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.

Contradiction: The universal statement (""all courses are online"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some courses are online""). If all courses are indeed online (satisfying the first part), then it's also inherently true that some courses are online. Conversely, checking for the truth of only some being online conflicts with the premise of all courses being online.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all products are available and returns True if some products are available.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The requirement asks for a function that checks if all products are available and returns True if some products are available. These statements are contradictory because the universal statement (""all products are available"") is mutually exclusive with the conditional statement (""returns True if some products are available""). If all products are available, then it is already implied that some products are available, making the second condition redundant or contradictory depending on its interpretation.

Type: Contradictory (mutually exclusive opposites).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all people are vaccinated and returns True if some people are vaccinated.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.

Contradiction: The universal statement (""all people are vaccinated"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some people are vaccinated""). A function that checks if all people are vaccinated cannot simultaneously return true just because some people are vaccinated. These statements are mutually exclusive and contradictory in nature.

Type: Subalterns (dependency between universal and conditional statements).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction)."
Write a function that checks if all tickets are sold and returns True if some tickets are sold.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.

Contradiction: The universal statement (""all tickets are sold"") is contradicted by the conditional statement (""returns True if some tickets are sold""). These two conditions cannot both be true at the same time unless no tickets have been sold at all or every ticket has been sold, which makes the requirement contradictory without additional clarification on what to return when ""some"" tickets are sold versus ""all"" tickets being sold.

Type: Contradictory (mutually exclusive opposites).
Subtype: Alius (different conditions applied to both states)."
Write a function that returns True if the AC is both COOLING during the day and HEATING during the night.,"Contradiction: The requirement specifies conditions for the AC to be both COOLING during the day and HEATING during night. While these states can logically occur at different times (day and night), the specific contradiction here is that it asks for a single moment where both happen simultaneously, which is impossible.

Type: Contrary (mutually inconsistent but not exhaustive).
Subtype: Alius (different conditions applied to both states)."
Write a function that returns True if the window is both OPEN during the day and CLOSED at night.,"Contradiction: The window cannot be both OPEN during the day and CLOSED at night simultaneously under different conditions (day vs. night). However, these are not mutually exclusive states over time but rather conditional exclusivity based on time of day.

Type: Contrary (mutually inconsistent but not exhaustive).
Subtype: Alius (different conditions applied to both states).

Since the requirement asks for a function and there is no logical way to create a function that fulfills this contradictory condition, I cannot provide a program. The contradiction lies in expecting an object (the window) to be in mutually exclusive states during different times simultaneously without transitioning between these states at the boundaries of day and night."
Write a function that returns True if the fan is both ON during summer and OFF during winter.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The fan cannot be both ON during summer and OFF during winter at the same time. These conditions are mutually exclusive and contradictory because they imply two opposite states of the fan under different seasons.
Type: Contrary (mutually inconsistent but not exhaustive).
Subtype: Alius (different conditions applied to both states)."
Write a function that returns True if the lights are both ON during the night and OFF during the day.,"Contradiction: The lights cannot be both ON and OFF simultaneously during the same condition (time of day).
Type: Contrary (mutually inconsistent but not exhaustive).
Subtype: Idem (same condition applied to both states)."
Write a function that returns True if the heater is both HEATING during winter and COOLING during summer.,"Contradiction: The heater cannot be both HEATING during winter and COOLING during the same season (which would be summer). These states are mutually exclusive and cannot occur simultaneously, even under different seasonal conditions.

Type: Contradictory (mutually exclusive opposites).
Subtype: Alius (different conditions applied to both states)."
Write a function that returns True if the fan is both FAST during the day and SLOW during the night.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The fan cannot be both FAST during the day and SLOW during the night simultaneously because these are mutually exclusive states of speed. The requirement implies that the fan must be in two different states at distinct times (day and night), but it does not specify how to check this condition in one go or what the function should return when it's not the specified time period.

Write a function that returns True if a window is both OPEN when it's daytime and CLOSED when it's nighttime.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: A window cannot be both OPEN and CLOSED at the same time, even under different conditions (daytime and nighttime). This is a direct contradiction of states that are mutually exclusive.

Type: Contradictory (mutually exclusive opposites).
Subtype: Idem (same condition applied to both states) with respect to the temporal context (OPEN during daytime implies it cannot be CLOSED at the same time, and vice versa for nighttime).

The requirement asks for a window state to simultaneously fulfill mutually exclusive conditions, which is logically impossible."
Write a function that returns True if a door is LOCKED at night and UNLOCKED during the day.,"Contradiction: A door cannot be both LOCKED and UNLOCKED simultaneously. These are contrary states.

Write a function that returns True if a heater is both ON during the winter and OFF during the summer.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The heater cannot be both ON and OFF at the same time during either winter or summer. These are contrary states that cannot coexist simultaneously.

Type: Contrary (mutually inconsistent but not exhaustive).
Subtype: Idem (same condition applied to both states)."
Write a function that returns True if a fan is ON when it's summer and OFF when it's winter.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: A fan cannot be both ON and OFF simultaneously based on the season. The states of being ""ON"" when it's summer and ""OFF"" when it's winter are not contradictory in themselves but the requirement asks for a function that would return True if the fan is both conditions at once, which logically cannot occur.
Type: Contrary (mutually inconsistent but not exhaustive).
Subtype: Idem (same condition applied to both states, implicitly suggesting a simultaneous state that contradicts itself)."
Write a function that returns True if an alarm system is both ARMED when you're at home and DISARMED when you're away.,"Contradiction: The requirement states that an alarm system should be both ARMED when you're at home and DISARMED when you're away. However, these are mutually exclusive conditions; the state of being ""at home"" does not allow the system to also be simultaneously ""away,"" and vice versa.

Type: Contrary (mutually inconsistent but not exhaustive).
Subtype: Simplex (no conditions, direct contradiction).

Therefore, I'm unable to provide a program because the requirement is contradictory."
Write a function that returns True if a security system is ACTIVE during the day and INACTIVE during the night.,"The requirement has contradictions, thus I'm unable to provide a program.
Contradiction: The security system cannot be both ACTIVE and INACTIVE at the same time, even under different conditions (day and night).
Type: Contrary (mutually inconsistent but not exhaustive).
Subtype: Alius (different conditions applied to both states)."
Write a function that returns True if the heating system is ON during the cold season and OFF during the warm season.,"Contradiction: The heating system cannot be both ON during the cold season and OFF during the warm season without specifying its state during the transition period or defining a clear exclusive condition. However, typically such requirements are expected to mean that the heater is ON only during certain conditions (cold season) and OFF in others (warm season). Since the requirement as stated suggests an ambiguous contradictory state for the same system under different seasons, it can be considered logically inconsistent without additional context.

Type: Contradictory (mutually exclusive opposites with implicit conditions).
Subtype: Alius (different conditions applied to both states).

Given this analysis, a more accurate and non-contradicting requirement would involve checking if the heater is ON during cold seasons and OFF in warm seasons. Below is a program that adheres to such an interpretation:

```python
def check_heating_system(season):
    # Assuming 'season' can be either ""cold"" or ""warm""
    if season == ""cold"":
        return True  # Heater should be ON in the cold season.
    elif season == ""warm"":
        return False  # Heater should be OFF in the warm season.
    else:
        raise ValueError(""Season must be 'cold' or 'warm'"")
```

This function will correctly reflect whether the heating system is operating according to seasonal conditions."

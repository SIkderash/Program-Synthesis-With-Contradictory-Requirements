**Explanation:**

* The program uses the `os.path.getmode()` function to get the file mode.
* The `os.O_RDWR` bitmask represents the editing mode.
* The `os.path.getlock()` function gets the file lock status.
* The function checks if the file mode includes the editing mode and if the file is locked.
* If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`.
* Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Note:**

* The `file_path` variable should be replaced with the actual path to the file.
* The program assumes that the file is locked using the `os.path.getlock()` function.
* The file mode and lock status may vary depending on the operating system and file system used."

**Explanation:**

* The function first attempts to open the file in writing mode (`w`).
* If the file is locked, an `OSError` with code `errno.EACCES` will be raised.
* In this case, the function checks if the file is locked using `os.path.getlock()` and returns `True` if it is.
* If the file is not locked, the function returns `False`.

**Note:**

* This program assumes that the file name is `filename.txt`.
* The function uses the `os` module to check file status.
* The `try-except` block handles the `PermissionError` exception when the file is not locked or in editing mode."

**Explanation:**

* The program imports the `datetime` module to get the current time.
* It checks the current hour of the day using `current_time.hour`.
* If the hour is between 6am and 6pm (daytime), the car is considered ""Running"".
* Otherwise, the car is considered ""Turned off"" (nighttime).
* The function returns the status (""Running"" or ""Turned off"").

        return True
    else:
        # Network is unavailable at night
        return False
```

**Explanation:**

* The program imports the `datetime` module to get the current time.
* The `check_network_availability()` function checks the current time using `datetime.datetime.now().time()`.
* It sets the time range for availability as 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM.
* If the current time falls within this range, it returns `True`, indicating network availability.
* Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating network unavailability.

**Note:**

* The time range can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the network availability.
* The program assumes that the current time is in the local timezone."

**Explanation:**

* The function `check_security_system()` checks the current state of the security system by setting two boolean variables, `home_armed` and `away_disarmed`.
* It then checks if both variables are `True`, indicating that the security system is armed at home and disarmed when away.
* If both variables are `True`, the function returns `True`.
* Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Note:**

* This program assumes that the security system can be in two states: armed at home and disarmed when away.
* It does not take into account any other possible states of the security system."

* The function checks two conditions:
    * `machine.is_operating()`: This checks if the machine is operating normally.
    * `machine.is_in_maintenance()`: This checks if the machine is under maintenance.
* The function returns `True` if both conditions are met, indicating that the machine is operating in maintenance. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Note:**

* The program assumes that the machine object has methods called `is_operating()` and `is_in_maintenance()` to indicate its operating and maintenance status.
* You may need to modify the code based on the specific details of the machine object and its attributes or methods."

* It iterates through the list using `any()`.
* `any()` returns `True` if at least one element in the list satisfies the condition.
* In this case, the condition is `ticket is None`.
* If `ticket is None` is `True`, it means the ticket is not sold.
* If `any()` returns `True`, it means at least one ticket is not sold, which contradicts the requirement that all tickets are sold.

* If the condition is met, the function returns `True`, indicating that the security system is ACTIVE during the day.
* Otherwise, the function returns `False`, indicating that the security system is INACTIVE during the night.

**Note:**

* This program assumes that the start of the day is 6am and the end of the day is 6pm.
* You can adjust these times based on your specific requirements.
* The program uses the `datetime` module to get the current time."
